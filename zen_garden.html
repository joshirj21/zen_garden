                            There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire,
                            and
                            encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking

                        <p>CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way
                            this

        </h2>
        <p>
            Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4 should be limited to widely-supported
            elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical CSS
            and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by  2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we
            have is that your CSS validates.
